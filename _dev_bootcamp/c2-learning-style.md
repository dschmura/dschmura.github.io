title: Thinking in style

My Gregorc Thinking Style leans toward the random, leaning more to Concrete Random than anything. Concrete Random learners like to experiment, solve problems independently, and use intuition when learning.

This is really true for me. I love to get inside of something, break it down and get to know not only _how_ something works but _why_ it works that way. This is really good for developing deep understanding. However, this is _REALLY_ inefficient for rapid new learning.

To be honest, this is kicking my ass. The rapid pace for Dev Bootcamp, in addition to my regularly scheduled life (which includes a full time job, running a company, being a husband and dog owner) barely leaves time for me to touch on the lessons once let alone reflect and dissect them.

I am frustrated...and overwhelmed. Today it really hit hard. I woke up and started filling in my assignments in the submitterator app. Are I went to submit the link for this blog post, I discovered that the entry I wrote yesterday had disappeared. This hasn't happened to me since...well...I can't remember a time since college, and that was half a lifetime ago. I am chalking it up to being, in general, overwhelmed.

I am very comfortable with the notion of adapting to optimize what I can in a given situation. I know that because I tend to approach problems in a certain way, and feel comfortable learning in certain ways, that I can adapt.

I am trying to get caught up enough to take a few moments to reflect on the bigger picture. I want to define 'spaces' in my day to reflect. I am busy enough that I feel like I am just bouncing from one task to the next without synthesizing...without getting to the higher ordered bit. I want to define times when I am not _doing_ but just _reflecting_. And, to be clear, writing these blog entries can be a gift, a space for reflection...but I have been approaching them as another task. Now that I think about it though...if I pause for just a second, I can get a little bit of perspective.

I am not sure where this fits in, but I did just notice that I am getting more efficient using Sublime Text...so while I still don't really feel comfortable with JavaScript (I certainly don't feel confident writing it), there is that.
