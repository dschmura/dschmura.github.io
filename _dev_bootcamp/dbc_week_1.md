title: DBC Week One
---

So, week one of DevBootcamp has come to an end...ish. I mean, it never really ends right? And that is the point/beauty of it. When I first started thinking about doing this crazy thing, I had some goals. I kept my goals loose. I didn't pin my definition of success with finding a new job, a salary bump, launching a new app or any of the typical markers that we use to measure our success. I chose, instead, to take a blind leap.

The calculation was thus: If I could survive all (or at least part) of DBC, I would certainly expand my knowledge set. I have joked that my choice to attend DBC was my 'mid-life crisis'. It is true.

Truth be told, I felt stuck. I have been feeling a pull towards complacency with work...and life in general. I had developed patterns of existing that felt a bit oppressive. Part of my thinking about engaging in this endeavor revolved around how to 'reboot' my life.

So, I set the bar at, essentially, upset the apple cart.

Well, that worked out well! Honestly, I had no idea how difficult this reboot would be. First, by leaving I abandoned 95% of the patterns that held my life together. I am living in a studio apartment, sleeping on a futon, and totally alone. I don't have the usual interruptions...touchstones...that demarcate the day available to me. Forgoing the natural rhythms of daily life has resulted in a LOT of anxiety this week. I have described for the members of my cohort how I have not slept well, and have lamented the lack of a cat awakening me by licking my head at 3 in the morning.

I can't count the number of times I almost burst into tears during this week. I resisted, not because of typical 'men don't cry' reasons, but because I didn't want to confuse my fellow students. I know myself well enough to know that my falling apart does not necissarily mean I am in crisis. It does mean that I am feeling powerfully. Anyway, I chose not to go that way this week.

I did share that I was struggling though. I sought, and got support. Sometime during the week one of my new friends asked if I wanted a hug and I took him up on it. I am glad I did! It was the morning after one of my worst nights sleeping, when my anxiety was at a peak, and I was feeling particularly lonely. I think that hug kept me from leaving the program.

I have also been taking as much advantage of the support offerings as I can. Meditations, reflections, yoga, checkins etc... I really do appreciate how many opportunities we are given to break out of the anxiety cycle.

At the end of the day Friday our cohort was brought together and reminded that this learning enivronment might not be the best for everyone. We were asked to spend the weekend reflecting on our experience so far, and assured that if we decided that this was not the path for us, there was no shame in stepping off here.

To be honest, I don't know right now. The first week was intense, and I am promised that subsequent weeks will be moreso.
