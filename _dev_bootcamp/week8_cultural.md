title: "Conflict re: solution"
---


I find that emotional conflict occurs most often as a result of mis-understanding or mis-interpretation. There are occasions when a conflict emerges as the result of a direct affront or intentional manipulation, but more often than not it is accidental.

Believing this to be true provides a powerful starting point for navigating discord. It is... disarming. When we perceive ourselves to be in conflict with someone else, our first impulse is to fight or flee. This is normal. However, if we are able to pause for a beat and assess if the conflict is an actual attack, or if it is the result of a mis-understanding, we give our selves a broader set of options for how to proceed.

Recently, I experienced an issue with a colleague at work. We have been working on different aspects of the same project. Without going into details, there were several occasions when this colleague did things that I perceived as undermining the project. In spite of having clear direction and verbally agreeing to a plan, this individual would do something very different.

My initial impulse was to confront this person and demand that they stop undermining the project. It seemed clear to me, and others who I consulted with that there was little room for misunderstanding. In fact, my supervisor believed that this person's actions were insubordinate and represented such a problem that human resources should be involved. However, I looked for a deeper understanding of 'why' this colleague was doing what they were doing.

After careful consideration, and lots of back and forth, it became clear to me that this person was reacting to a threat that they perceived. Due to changes in the project, they thought that their role was being minimized and that their job was actually in jeopardy. (Ironically, it wasn't until their behavior created such problems.)

My approach with working with this individual changed to being more reassuring, when I could and to double down on reaching consensus and clear understanding. This seemed to help. The undermining behavior lessened as did the tension.

To be honest, I am not sure how I feel about the outcome. On the one hand, my adjustment worked to ameliorate the problem, but on the other...the behavior was so detrimental...so problematic, that there really should have been consequences. I am not an advocate for punishment as an end unto itself, but I do feel a loathing at the thought of working on another project with this individual.

That being said, such remedies are not available to me. I am not in a supervisory role in relation to this person, and I had limited recourse in addressing the underlying behavior from that end. So, I suppose I did the best I could with a bad situation and made it work.
