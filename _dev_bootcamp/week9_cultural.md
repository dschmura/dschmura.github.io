title: There are no stupid questions, but there are inefficient ones.
---
In a former life I had a role that was akin to a therapist. In fact I facilitated group therapy sessions for teenagers and their parents, as well as dorm parents at a residential boarding school. The reason I bring this up is that my experience facilitating group therapy has informed my appreciation for the importance of forming good questions.

A 'quality' question is one that efficiently leads to an answer or moves one closer to an answer. As a therapist, part of the game is to manage your time effectively. You have but an hour to make progress. To do this you need the ability formulate incisive questions that, in a way, gently force the recipient to clarify their thinking about an issue. Client's don't always want to look at issues that confront them. A good therapist will formulate questions that walk the client towards awareness, in steps that allow them to learn and grow at an appropriate pace (for the client).

The question is the key. There is nuance, and opportunity in the formation of a question that portends it's answer. I don't mean to imply that the question leads the answer, but a good question allows for clarity to emerge.

More recently I worked as a sys admin at a major university. I would argue that the primary skill, beyond all of the technical comprehension, was the ability to ask good questions. As it turns out, faculty members at premier universities tend to be highly skilled and highly regarded. That being said, their skill set does not always mean they are adept at computer technology. They are, however, accustomed to being the smartest person (sometimes on the planet). So when they are in a situation where they need support, they may be forgiven an impulse to hide what they do not know. A good sys admin is able to formulate questions that simultaneously move closer to the answer, while preserving the dignity of the recipient.

In thinking about asking good questions, it is important to remember that the quality of a question is only measured by how well it moves one towards an answer. If the question is boolean (either true or false), it is easy to recognize success. Formulating a query that results in either a yay or a nay is fairly easy. However, if you are asking for a more nuanced answer, the formulation can be difficult.

It is also important to recognize, at a meta level, where the questioner is starting from. Are they (you) trying to disguise a knowledge gap that you have judged to be embarrassing? By getting clear with yourself, you can save a lot of time and effort. If you are embarrassed by your particular knowledge gap, it is best to know that, and acknowledge that (if only to yourself) up front.

Not having clarity on your true intention (especially when your intention is to hide your perceived knowledge gap), will lead to poorly formed questions. The answer wont come because you haven't asked an honest question. I don't want to admonish people for doing this. It happens...and is understandable if you think about human psychology. I would argue however, that it is a very inefficient way to pursue answers.
