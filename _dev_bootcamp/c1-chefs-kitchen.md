# Sir, your presence is requested in the kitchen.

One of the things that drew me to DevBootcamp is the focus on the development of people, not code. (Granted, the code is part of it...but bear with me.)

I liked Shereef's analogy of the kitchen and the restaurant. It is a welcome reminder that complacency is a choice. A large part of my going through bootcamp is to exercise this choice for myself.

It is easy to view transactions passively. We have been trained that it is a virtue to pay extra so that you don't have to worry about such things. If I pay the money, I get the reward...guarenteed right? We forget that WE are the guarentee. If I want to succeed, nay, to be awesome at bootcamp, I need to make that choice.

I am excited, and a bit terrified after this first week. And that is exactly why I am choosing to do this. I'm too young to get comfortable.

"It only works if everybody walking through the door says 'This is my program! This is my nine weeks! I'm going to make them amazing!'" (Shereef).

Well... <span id="my_time">This is my program! This is my nine weeks! I'm going to make them amazing!</span>
