_'IDs are unique and beautiful snowflakes. Classes are not.' - Rob Glazebrook_

Humans seem to have an infinite ability to conflate class with id. I would argue that this is one of the most common causes of friction in society, and even in our psychological understanding of ourselves.

As it goes with humanity, it goes with the code that we use to represent the internet for humans. So I will try to offer some clarification to this human conflation that has caused so many problems in our world.

First let me start by stating, clearly, that one's class and one's id are not the same. One can be born into a class, or aspire to a class. One can graduate with a class, or join a class. However, one's class does not define one's id.

One's id is more personal. It is an indication of what one is, at it's essence and, I would argue, in that moment. ID's are more transitory, more fluid. When I wake up in the morning I have the id of 'master' in relation to our dog. (**side_note: I don't see myself as 'master', but that is what we call humans in relation to their pets.) I wake up and almost immediately feed him. Then my id changes to 'husband' where I make lattes for my wife.

Eventually I will go to work where my id is set to 'colleague'. 'Colleague is styled with khaki pants and a button down.' This is how you know that 'colleague' is an id. A temporary fixture. It may define what I look like now, but it doesn't not define the nature of who I am.

Class however, I would argue, does. I am not saying that class is immutable (I am an American, and we kinda think that the idea of class mobility is sacrosanct.) but I do think it represents a more fundamental, deeply rooted aspect of who we are.

Let me put it this way. I can never NOT be a middle-aged, white man who grew up with an upper-middle-class lifestyle in the suburbs. I just can't. I can have an appreciation of this, I can contextualize it, I can not let it make me act like a dick, but I cannot change this fundamental thing.

I will never really know what it is liked to be profiled. It is something I can imagine, but have never experienced. (Imagining and actually experiencing a thing are VERY different beasts.)

CSS classes are similar to one's own class in that it defines a more foundational element. If you assume that everything of a type is going to have certain characteristics, it would be a class.

Ids are more specific...more contextual if you will. A single element (a person, or a data element displayed on a web page) may adopt an id in one instance (khakis to the office) and a different one in a different instance shorts and a t-shirt when mowing the lawn. The element (me) is the same, but how I dress and behave is different based on the context.
