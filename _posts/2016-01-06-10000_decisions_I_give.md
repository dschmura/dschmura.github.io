title: 10000 decisions I give
---

Don't hire me to write code. A lot of people can write code, and a lot of them can do it better (certainly faster) than I can. Hire me for the 10000 decisions I will make on your behalf. Hire me for the 10000 choices that I make leveraging my extensive experience and what I know about your best interests. Hire me for my focus.
